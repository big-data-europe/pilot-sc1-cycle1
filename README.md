## Overview
This repository is meant to provide insight into the technical procedure and requirements of the first pilot for Societal Challenge "Health" and to guide you to install it by yourself. By understanding the technology and the process-flows, we hope to encourage you to use it for your own domain. Yes, the Open PHACTS platform is built for researchers in Drug Discovery, however by design the technology itself is independent from the domain. Once you got familiar with the code and got it running by yourself, you should have enough experience to upload your own Linked Data, and create your own API. The  e success of the Open PHACTS project especially the architectural design decisions,

## Background
The [Open PHACTS foundation](http://www.openphactsfoundation.org/) (BigDataEurope consortium partner) is dedicated to developing and sustaining the Open PHACTS Discovery Platform. The platform is the result of an [Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI)](http://www.openphactsfoundation.org/about/project-history/) project and facilitates researchers to access and query publicly-available pharmacological data. 
[Stian Soiland-Reyes](https://github.com/stain) is the main contributor and leader of the [Open PHACTS docker](https://github.com/openphacts/ops-docker) work.
In collaboration with the [VU University Amsterdam](http://www.vu.nl) (both a member of the Open PHACTS foundation and the BigDataEurope consortium), the Open PHACTS foundation leads the work on Societal Challenge "Health" (SC1) in the BigDataEurope project. 


All the data brought together by Open PHACTS is free to access, to help researchers in drug discovery to find and use the information they need.in the BigDataEurope consortium.

The [Open PHACTS Discovery Platform](http://www.openphacts.org/) 
The Open PHACTS Discovery Platform is bringing together pharmacological data resources in an integrated, interoperable infrastructure, and has been developed to reduce barriers to drug discovery in industry, academia and for small businesses.
